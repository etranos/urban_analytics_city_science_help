## Why should we care about cities?

The most overused figure [@un_urban_rural]...

> In 2009 for the first time in history 2009 more than 50% of the population lived within cities

... but still true!

Source of:

-   economic growth,

-   innovation - technology - ...,

-   but also - pandemics (!)

## Why should we care about cities?

-   Strong links historically between [@mccann2011globalization]:
    -   Globalisation
    -   Urbanisation
    -   Industrialisation

## Urban analytics and city science

-   Understand cities and how they change
-   Use critically and effectively urban data
-   Understand and master methodological tools
-   Support urban policy making

## Different terms

-   Academics love inventing new terms
-   Urban science, city science, urban analytics, urban geography, geographic data science, urban data science, complexity science, TheNextBigThing
-   Have a look: @urbananalytics

## Why do cities exist?"

-   An economist's answer: to *economise*!
-   Because of economies of scale and agglomeration economies

## Scale economies

-   AKA *increasing returns to scale*, or
-   AKA *economies of scale*
-   Business enterprises become more efﬁcient at large scales of operation
-   More output per unit of input than at smaller scales
-   ➔ larger enterprises
-   Within firms

## Scale economies

Increasing returns to scale

::: incremental
-   double ALL the inputs ➔
-   more than double output

## Scale economies

How do they affect space?

::: incremental
-   Clustering of workers near factories
-   Clustering of services for workers near factories
-   The *company town* example
-   Illustrative
:::

## Agglomeration economies

-   AKA External economies of scale
-   External to the firm
-   **Very important for cities**
-   Two types:
    -   Localisation economies AKA Marshallian externalities
    -   Urbanisation economies AKA Jacobian externalities

## Localization Economies

-   Within a group of firms of the same industry
-   clustered together at the same place
-   Why?
    -   Information exchange
    -   Labour mobility
    -   Specialist services

Examples: Silicon Valley (micro-electronics), The City of London (finance), Detroit and Michigan (automobile), Seattle (aerospace), etc.

## Localization Economies

![](images/nesta_clusters.png)

## Urbanization economies

-   Firms across different sectors
-   Clustered together at the same place [@lifedeathcities]
-   A city
-   Why?
    -   Support services to firms experiencing internal and localization economies
    -   Clustering
    -   Increased local factor prices
    -   Economies of scale

## Agglomeration economies

-   Diversity vs. specialization
-   Internal economies of scale (firm specific)
-   Localization economies (industry specific)
-   Urbanization economies (city specific)

## The sources of agglomeration

1.  Knowledge spillovers [@marshall1890principles]

-   Interactions between employees of different firms
-   Proximity
-   Tacit knowledge
-   Mutual trading of information

## The sources of agglomeration economies

2.  Non-traded local inputs

-   Efficient provision of specialist inputs
-   Infrastructure

## The sources of agglomeration economies

3.  Local skilled labour pool

-   Sufficient quantity of labour to respond to market changes
-   Specialised labour / cost of training

## The sources of agglomeration economies

-   Processes of learning, sharing and matching [@duranton2004]
-   Clustering:
    -   Interaction
    -   Dynamic
    -   ➔ reduces knowledge and information transaction cost
-   Higher profitability for firms within the cluster than those outside the cluster

## Agglomeration economies: pecuniary vs. technological

-   Pecuniary ➔ input cost reduction
-   *make inputs cheaper in larger cities*
-   Technological ➔ raise productivity
-   *make inputs more productive in larger cities*

## Agglomeration economies: a citique

Bounded rationality [@simon1955behavioral; @simon1966theories]

-   Information about space and location in limited
-   Relocation issues, the ability of a rational decision is limited
-   Relocation cost

## Why cities do exist?

To *economise*!

In other words, collocation of people and firms increases efficiency.

## Urban models: looking into cities

The Burgess model

![](images/burgess.png)

<small> Source: [bbc.co.uk](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zckdg82/revision/1) </small>

## Urban models: looking into cities

The Burgess model

-   Created by E.W. Burgess in 1925
-   Developed in rings, reflecting waves of immigrants
-   Used Chicago as his model
-   Most European cities developed this way (pre-automobile)

## Urban models: looking into cities

The Von Thünen model (The isolated state in 1826)

-   Basic idea: Agricultural land uses follow predictable patterns around cities, which are the markets for the farm goods
-   Goods with greatest demand and having the highest transport costs should be produced closest to the city

Central place theory

![](images/christaller.jpg){width="150%"}

<small> Source: @wood2012economic adapted from @christaller1966central </small>

## Urban models: systems of cities

Central place theory

-   Spatial distribution of cities and towns in Southern Germany
-   Inductive instead of deductive
-   Hierarchy of 3 different goods (3, 2, 1), 3 different market areas and 3 different levels of urban centres
-   Assumptions: homogeneous land and equal
-   Transport possibilities in all directions

## Urban models: systems of cities

The core-periphery model

::: r-fit-text
::: incremental
-   2 region model

-   Transport cost steadily fall over time

-   As transport cost ⟱, separation of production and consumption becomes feasible

-   ⤇ Core-periphery

## Summary

-   Urban structure is not random
-   Multiple scales: individual, neighbourhoods, cities, urban networks
-   Cities are complex adaptive systems

## Network Science: The Evolution of a 'New' Science

-   Not really new

-   Graph Theory in the 18th century

-   Leonhard Euler's work on small graphs

-   High degree of regularity: similar degree centrality among different nodes

## Regular graphs

```{r, fig.height=5}
grViz("
graph {

# a graph statement
graph [layout = circo,
      rankdir = RL]

# a node statement
node [shape = circle,
      style = filled,
      color = grey,
      fillcolor = orange];
nodesep=4
A; B; C; D; E; F; G; H;

# an edge statement
edge [color = grey]

A -- B
B -- C
C -- D
D -- E
E -- F
F -- G
G -- H
H -- A
A -- D
H -- E
B -- G
C -- F
}")
```

## 1st milestone: Random networks (RN)

-   20th Century: advances in mathematics and statistics  algorithmic network analysis

-   @erdHos1960evolution

-   Large scale networks with no obvious structure

-   Nodes degree follows a Poisson distribution: similar degree, close to the average degree <k>, rare exceptions

-   Representative of real world network?

## Networks become important...

-   ... in different fields, from social science to biology

-   Digitization of data in many different fields + large databases ➔ real world systems as networks

-   Advances in computer science and in computing

-   Looseness between different disciplinary boundaries

-   Reductionist approaches lose ground in favor of holistic research approaches, which try to understand the system as a whole

## 2nd milestone: Small-worlds

-   Small world effect

-   [Milgram's six degrees of separation (1967)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_experiment)

-   Bacon number

-   Short average distances, enabling nodes to reach each other within a few steps

-   Characteristic of numerous real world networks

-   Structural characteristic rather than an organizing principle

-   Even RN networks are characterized by short average distances

## 2nd milestone: Small-worlds

-   @watts1998collective Small-world (SW) model

-   Coexistence of short average distance with high clustering coefficient

-   SW networks are located between regular and random networks:

-   Highly clustered like regular lattices

-   Small distances like random networks

-   Node degree distribution is quite similar with the RN and decays exponentially

## 2nd milestone: Small-worlds

-   A set of intensively interconnected local clusters, which gain global connectivity via a few links, which span the entire network linking distant clusters

-   Nodes in SW networks benefit from the high local connectivity and easy distant communication with remote clusters using the intra-cluster links

-   Probability of finding a highly connected node decreases exponentially as highly connected nodes are practically absent in RN and SW models

## 2nd milestone: Small-worlds

**Pros and cons**

-   Social capital (bridging and bonding)

-   Disease spread

-   Real world examples?

## 3rd milestone: Scale-free (SF) networks

<small>

-   @barabasi1999emergence

-   Very few super connected nodes and a vast majority of less connected nodes

-   SF: nodes degree distribution follows a power law distribution regardless the scale of observation

-   2 main formation mechanisms:

    -   **growth**; expansion of networks over time

    -   **preferential attachment**: growth is not equally dispersed across the nodes; highly connected nodes are more likely to receive new links than the lower degree nodes

</small>

## 3rd milestone: Scale-free (SF) networks

-   An initial difference in the connectivity between two nodes will increase further as the network grows

-   This is a cumulative --- *rich get richer* --- process

-   The probability $P(k)$ that a node has a degree $k$ decays following a power function, with usually $2 < \gamma < 3$

    $P(k)≈𝑘^{−\gamma}$

-   Power laws in networks are related with the existence of **both of the above two mechanisms**

-   Later versions of SF models included more realistic options for the network growth

And finally the power law...

## 3rd milestone: Scale-free (SF) networks

**Pros and cons?**

-   Efficiency

-   Resilience

-   Disease spread prevention

-   Vulnerability towards targeted attacks

-   Real world examples?

## Network Science: a summary

-   Both RN and SW have short average distances

-   RN cannot be included in SW because they lack the high clustering coefficient

-   SF networks share the short average distance and the high cluster coefficient of SW ones, but the SW are not characterized by the scale-free distribution

-   All scale free networks display small world properties, while all small-world networks are not necessarily scale free

## Network science: An epistemological discussion

**1. Complexity Science**

-   Most studies in the network science domain have a starting point in statistical physics

-   Stochastic approaches

-   Underlying probability model which usually follows a power law

-   *Main objective:* identification of the underlying mechanisms using generative modeling and simulation

-   *Potential risk:* the probability model might not follow a power law mechanism, which is a common assumption

## Network science: An epistemological discussion

**2. Social Network Analysis**

-   Sociology and graph theory

-   Focus on social networks

-   Extensive utilization of network metrics

## Network science: An epistemological discussion

**3. Geography and Urban Analytics**

-   Softer' approaches

-   Ex-post empirical modeling for identifying characteristics of theoretical network models in real world networks

-   Global and local network statistics

-   Use of network measures in mainstream statistical modeling

-   Empirical verification of the functions that better explain the node degree distribution (power vs. exponential functions)

-   Spatial networks, but also dynamic networks

# Scaling

## What is scale and scaling

::: incremental
-   Scale in geography

-   Scale in math:

    -   $y(x_i)$ a function of $x_i$ where $i$ is a spatial unit

    -   If we scale $x$ by some scalar $\lambda$, **the function scales** if its scaled value is proportional to its previous value: $y(\lambda x_i) \propto y(x_i)$

    -   $y(x_i) = x_i^a$

    -   $y(\lambda x_i) = (\lambda x_i)^a = \lambda^a x_i^a = \lambda^a y(x_i)$

-   Quantitative revolution post WW2

-   Cultural turn

-   ... today ...

<!-- Tobler's two laws: and then gravity. And then gravity as urban scaling -->

<!-- Gibrat's law: he average growth rates of dif ferent cities are the same in an urban system. ?? nope -->

<!-- Zipf's law -->

## Metcalfe's law / Moore's law

-   As cities grow...

-   ... the number of potential connections increases as the square of population.

-   $C = p(p-1)/2 \propto p^2$

## von Thunen's law

-   As cities grow in size ...

-   land values decline non-linearly from the centre

## Law of gravitation / Tobler's law

-   As cities grow...

-   .. interactions between them decline with increasing distance

-   Newton law of gravitation

## Zipf law

-   As cities get larger...

-   ... there are less of them

-   Regularity in the distribution of cities within a country

-   Empirical observation and quantification

-   Hierarchical urban systems:

    -   one/a few big cities

    -   more medium size cities

    -   large number of very small cities

## Zipf law

-   Primary cities above what a Zipf law would predict

-   Newly industrialised countries

-   No overall consensus why the rank-size rule holds

-   Statistical regularity or an underpinning micro-economic process?

## Bettencourt-West or Marshall's law

-   As cities grow...

-   ... their average real income (and wealth) increases more than proportionately [@bettencourt2007growth]

$Y_i = Y_0P_i^\beta$

-   $Y_i$: material resources (energy or infrastructure) or social activity (wealth, patents, and pollution) in city $i$

-   $Y_o$: normalization constant

-   $P_i$: population of city i

-   $\beta$: exponent

## Epilogue

> Cities, of course, do not really have their own dynamics; they depend on decisions made by people, corporations, governments, and others. The aggregate statistics of all their decisions will therefore emerge as key and provide another con- nection to the uses of information in urban science. @bettencourt2021introduction

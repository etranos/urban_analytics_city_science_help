## Introduction

-   Big data vs. just data

-   Smart city

-   Urban dashboards

## Big data vs. just data

-   Digital traces human activities leave behind

-   Accidental [@arribas2014accidental]

-   Why?

-   Computing power together

-   Digital turn

-   Geospatial technologies \[*important for urban researchers*\]

## Big data vs. just data

::: r-fit-text
-   **Volume** \[how big is big?\]

-   **Velocity**, being created in or near real time

-   **Variety**, being structured and unstructured in nature

-   Exhaustive in scope, capture entire populations or systems

-   Fine-grained in resolution

-   Relational in nature, common fields that enable the merging of different data sets

-   Flexible, extensionable (can add new fields easily) and scalable (can expand in size rapidly) [@kitchin2013big].

Or, whatever doesn't fit in an excel spreadsheet (Batty, anecdotal)
:::

## Big data vs. just data

-   Biases

-   Need for new methods

-   Accidental

-   *Big data can speak for themselves*. Not really [@kitchin2013big]

## Smart cities, different approaces

The **digital technologies** approach

-   Urban infrastructure and services are managed computationally

-   Networked digital instrumentation embedded into the urban fabric

-   Continuous streams of data that dynamically feed into management systems and control rooms

-   New forms of governmentality

## Smart cities, different approaches

The **outputs** approach

-   Strategic use of information and communications technology (ICT)

-   ➔ smarter citizens, workers, policy, and programs

-   ➔ innovation, economic development, and entrepreneurship

-   ➔ urban resilience and sustainability

## Smart cities, different approaches

The **just** approach

-   ICT-led, citizen-centric model of development

-   ➔ social innovation and social justice, civic engagement and activism

-   ➔ transparent and accountable governance

## Smart cities, different approaches

In reality...

... a blend of all these approached

## Smart cities and data

-   (Smart) cities generate much more data nowadays

    -   e-government systems, city operating systems, centralized control rooms, digital surveillance, predictive policing, intelligent transport systems, smart grids, sensor networks, building management systems, civic apps ... [@kitchin2021fragmented]

## Smart cities and data

-   Local authorities are under pressure to release open data for:

    -   public scrutiny

    -   civic apps

-   Data reuse:

    -   internally facing

    -   externally facing

## Dashboards

> A visual display of the most important information needed to achieve one or more objectives; a consolidated and arranged on a single screen so the information can be monitored at a glance [@few2007dashboard]

## Dashboards

-   Transparency, open government philosophy, accountability [@young2022building]

-   Improve user's 'span of control of large and complex data

-   Share outputs

## Dashboards

-   Not just neutral, technical tools

-   Translators and engines rather than mirrors

-   Reductive in nature (vs. the complex nature of cities)

-   Decontextualize cities [@kitchin2016praxis]
